# â˜• JavaOdyssey  
*My daily journey of learning Java.*
 
This is where Iâ€™m documenting my **Java learning journey** â€” day by day, concept by concept.  
Iâ€™ll be sharing everything I practice, from basic syntax to advanced topics, all organized neatly into different branches.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside?
Iâ€™ve split my learnings into different branches so things stay clean and organized:

- **[Basics](https://github.com/Rudraksh22Menon/JavaOdyssey/tree/Basics)**  
  Starting with the foundation â€” variables, data types, loops, arrays, and other core concepts.

- **[OOP](https://github.com/<Rudraksh22Menon/JavaOdyssey/tree/oop)**  
  Diving into Object-Oriented Programming â€” classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

- **[Collections](https://github.com/Rudraksh22Menon/JavaOdyssey/tree/collections)**  
  Exploring Lists, Sets, Maps, Generics, and the power of Javaâ€™s collection framework.

- **[Advanced](https://github.com/Rudraksh22Menon/JavaOdyssey/tree/advanced)**  
  Going deeper â€” multithreading, streams, lambdas, and JVM magic.
